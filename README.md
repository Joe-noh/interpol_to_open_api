# InterpolToOpenAPI

This tool is made to be used in a process of work to convert Interpol definitions into Open API Specification v2.0.

Note that this does not aim complete conversion. Manual modification is premised and developed for only my use-case.

## Usage

Clone this repository and build. Publishing on Rubygem is not planned for now.

```
git clone https://github.com/Joe-noh/interpol_to_open_api

cd ./interpol_to_open_api

gem build interpol_to_open_api.gemspec
gem install interpol_to_open_api-0.x.x,gem
```
